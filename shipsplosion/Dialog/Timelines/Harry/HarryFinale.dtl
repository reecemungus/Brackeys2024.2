join Harry center
Ah, I had a feeling I'd bump into you here.
Look, I'm not gonna beg.
Take the last escape pod. But, take this photo to my Hayley.
Fulfill my promise, keep her dream alive.
- Let Harry take the escape pod
	But...but why? You've got your whole life ahead of you. Mine's dwindling away.
	Well, I must thank you. I get to see Hayley one last time.
- Take the escape pod yourself
	Thank you. Y'know, you've got a good heart kid.
	Goodbye, Hayley...I love you so much.
