Oh no, there's only one escape pod left.
Please, think of my children. I can't die here. They need to live.
I tried so hard to build a nice life for them...don't end it before it starts.
- Let Angela take the escape pod
	Thank you! Thank you so much! I won't forget this... My babies will live because of you.
- Take the escape pod yourself
	No, please. You can't do this! Think of my babies, pleaseeee...
