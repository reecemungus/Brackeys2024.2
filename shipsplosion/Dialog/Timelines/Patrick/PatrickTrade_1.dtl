Patrick: Hey, man. Could you pick up something me? You'd be doing me a solid.
Patrick: You see, my job sucks and they don't let me have much free time. So strict, I know.
Patrick: If you could go to the bar and pick me up a pint, you'll be making my life a whole lot better.
Patrick: In return, I'll give you the security keycard. We could hang out in the office and play with the pool table. My shifts would be WAYYYY less boring.
