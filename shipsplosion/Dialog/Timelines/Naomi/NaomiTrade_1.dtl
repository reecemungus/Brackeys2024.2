Naomi: Hey, newbie. Could you do me a favour?
Naomi: I need a first-aid kit for "health and safety" purposes, but I don't have one and... Look, I'd get one myself, but I think I'm already in enough trouble as it is with all of my daydreaming.
Naomi: So, you'd really be helping me out if you did this. I'll make it worth your while!
