join Patrick center
Damn, I was hoping I wouldn't meet you here.
Please, let me go, weatherman. I was never cut out to be a security man.
I wanna be able to live the life I was meant to live, with the love of my life. Not rotting away at this company.
- Let Patrick take the escape pod
	Thank you so much. This means so much to me. You're one of the good ones, weatherman.
- Take the escape pod yourself
	No, you can't. I thought the little guys were meant to look out for each other...
